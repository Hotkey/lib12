ib12 is set of useful classes and extension created for .net 4 core and WPF.

- Dependency injection
- Fluent SQL query builder
- Dummy and random data
- Set of extensions for standard classes
- FluidTextBox control
- Converters for WPF
- Event to command transcription
- Behaviors for WPF
- and more...

Use freely without limitation and let me know what you think about.
